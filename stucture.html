    <h2>HTML</h2>

    <p>
      The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
      such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
      or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
      included cues for the appearance of the document.

    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
      HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
      HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of
      presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
      separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
      control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
      multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
      separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
      structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the
      page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
